/**
 * This class is a Job with the purpose of specifically 
 * waiting on a barrier array to have a non-null value in the 
 * index 0 slot,  OR, to have a canceled progress monitor. 
 * 
 * This job does not guarantee an immediate return when an interrupt is received. 
 * The job does its best to clean up itself
 * after an interrupt is received, but it is up to the delegating runnable 
 * to handle such interrupts in an appropriate time.  
 * 
 * The purpose of this job is to ensure that a workflow exists to return as fast as possible
 * when a progress monitor is canceled. This class is most useful for tasks that may block
 * for a duration and may not have an opportunity to check for interrupts or a canceled flag. 
 * This job will segregate those threads into the background and clean them up in time, 
 * but primarily to ensure the fast return time upon cancelation.
 * 
 * Proper use of this job is as follows:
 * 
 *  BarrierProgressWaitJob j = new BarrierProgressWaitJob(name, runnable);
 *  j.schedule();
 *	// This join will also poll the provided monitor for cancelations
 *	j.monitorSafeJoin(monitor);
 *	if( j.getReturnValue() != null)
 *		return (ReturnType)j.getReturnValue();
 *
 * This job guarantees that a call to monitorSafeJoin() will return within 200ms of a 
 * cancelation in the progress monitor, or immediately upon the completion of the 
 * delegate runnable's execution, whichever comes first. 
 * 
 * In the event that a cancelation is registered, and the delegate runnable 
 * completes within the 200 ms, the Job may be recognized as both canceled and 
 * still have a valid return value from the delegate runnable. Clients should
 * decide whether they wish to prioritize their logic for a canceled call, 
 * or use the return value.
